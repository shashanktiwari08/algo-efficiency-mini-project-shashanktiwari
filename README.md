# Algorithm Efficiency Mini Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes the efficiency of recursive and iterative algorithms.  
We compare execution time and space usage of common algorithms and visualize their behavior.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement classic recursive and iterative algorithms
- Measure time and memory usage
- Visualize performance with plots
- Compare theoretical vs observed results

## 🛠️ Algorithms Implemented
- Fibonacci (Naïve Recursive, Dynamic Programming)
- Sorting: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort
- Binary Search

## 📊 Profiling & Visualization
- `time` module for execution time
- `memory_profiler` for space analysis
- `matplotlib` for plots
